# C++ Module 05 Overview

## Introduction

C++ Module 05 is part of the 42 school's curriculum designed to deepen your understanding of C++ programming, focusing on exception handling and further exploring object-oriented programming concepts. This module emphasizes the importance of robust error management and introduces advanced class hierarchies.

## Compilation

To compile the exercises in this module, you can use the provided `Makefile` by executing:

```
make
```
Or, if there is no Makefile:
```
c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98 *.cpp -o program
```
Run the program:
```
./exec_name(check Makefile)
```

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Exception Handling**

- **Introduction to Exceptions**: Learn how to use `try`, `catch`, and `throw` statements to handle runtime errors gracefully.
- **Standard Exceptions**: Utilize standard exception classes provided by the C++ Standard Library.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Define and implement your own exception classes to handle specific error conditions in your applications.

### 2. **Advanced Class Hierarchies**

- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Explore deeper into inheritance, allowing classes to derive properties and behaviors from existing classes, and understand how polymorphism enables dynamic method binding.
- **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**: Implement abstract classes with pure virtual functions to define interfaces that derived classes must implement.

## Exercises Overview

### Exercise 00: Introduction to Exceptions

- **Objective**: Implement a `Bureaucrat` class that demonstrates basic exception handling.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Throwing and catching exceptions.
  - Using standard exception classes.

### Exercise 01: Further Use of Exceptions

- **Objective**: Enhance the `Bureaucrat` class to handle more complex scenarios involving exceptions.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Chaining exceptions.
  - Implementing custom exception classes.

### Exercise 02: Combination of Abstract Classes and Exceptions

- **Objective**: Create an abstract `Form` class that interacts with the `Bureaucrat` class, incorporating exception handling.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Abstract classes and pure virtual functions.
  - Exception safety in class interactions.

### Exercise 03: Usage of the Abstract Class from Within a Class

- **Objective**: Develop concrete classes derived from the abstract `Form` class and integrate them with the `Bureaucrat` class.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Implementing concrete subclasses.
  - Managing exceptions across class hierarchies.

## Why Is This Important?

Mastering exception handling is crucial for developing robust and reliable software. It ensures that programs can gracefully handle unexpected situations without crashing. Additionally, understanding advanced class hierarchies, including abstract classes and interfaces, is essential for designing flexible and maintainable object-oriented systems.

## Conclusion

C++ Module 05 advances your knowledge of exception handling and object-oriented design. By completing this module, you will be equipped to write more resilient and modular C++ applications, capable of managing errors effectively and utilizing complex class structures.
